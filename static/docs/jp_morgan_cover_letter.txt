Hi! I'm Gustavo, 22, and I'd love to be considered as a candidate for the Software Engineering position at JP Morgan.

I've just come back to my home country (Brazil) after a semester of work and year of studies in the Netherlandsand I'm looking for more practical experience in the software engineering sector.

I'm looking forward to diving deep into a project and seeing it grow and improve alongside a supportive remote team. I'm a tinkerer and improver at heart, so I'm always looking for ways to streamlining existing processes, something I'd say is particularly handy when it comes to CI/CD.

I have worked 2+ years as a full-stack developer, and more specifically, at financial institutions, working on a backoffice environment. I think I'm completely qualified for the position; I'm very knowledgable when it comes to Java and its frameworks, RESTful microservices, relational database work, web-based development, using Git, etc.

I strive to do great things, and I'll gladly go the extra mile if that means I'll get the opportunity to work (and to keep working) with great people in a challenging setting. 

Thanks for taking me into consideration! Good luck on the search.
Gustavo Lu√≠s Rodrigues Luchetti
