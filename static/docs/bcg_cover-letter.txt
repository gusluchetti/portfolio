Dear BCG,

My name is Gustavo, I'm 22, and I'd love to be considered as a candidate for the 'Data Engineer - X Delivery' position.

I've just come back to my home country (Brazil) after a semester of work and year of studies in the Netherlands (A.I. Masters, incomplete) and I'm looking for more practical experience in the data engineering sector. I believe I am qualified when it comes to relevant work experience, I do feel there are some areas where I'm not an expert yet, but I do have the academic experience and the drive to develop those skills that are a bit lackluster.

I'm very confident using the command line, version control, and CI/CD tools. Previously as a full-stack developer, I worked with relational and NoSQL databases daily (specifically, PostgreSQL and MongoDB), and developed my front-end abilities (using Angular). At my last job, I gained a lot of experience with Python, charting libraries and web API testing and developing, for niche data integration purposes. I worked alongside the data platform and data science teams, so we were as responsible for the quality of the data coming in as they were. I'm always on the lookout for optimizations and I pride myself in maintaining and writing clean code.

I'm drawn to BCG not only because of its reputation as a leading management consulting firm, and its commitment to using data and analytics to drive business outcomes, but also because of the opportunity of working alongside the people that keep such a pristine reputation; I'd be ecsatic to work with talented professionals and to learn and evolve alongside them. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further and contributing to the success of Boston Consulting Group.

Sincerely,
Gustavo Lu√≠s Luchetti
