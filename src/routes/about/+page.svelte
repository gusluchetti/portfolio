<h2>bio</h2>
<p>
	Hi! My name is Gustavo Luchetti, a 23 year-old full-stack developer currently based in São Paulo,
	Brazil. Besides full-stack, I've worked with data integratiton for a bit, and studied Artificial
	Intelligence for a year. To no one's surprise, I game a lot! I also go bouldering from time to
	time, and I make a pretty good chocolate chip cookie.
</p>
<h2>purpose</h2>
<p>
	I see this website as both journal and portfolio. It’s very easy these days to consume content (or
	code) and to never give back, so this is my way of remeding that.
</p>
<p>
	My current goal is to write a blog post once a month, at the very least. I’ll try my best to stick
	to that schedule.
