It's time to get serious. What is happening with web development? I leave for a bit
and when I come back there's SSR, RSC, hydration this, runtime that. Oh boy.

This probably won't stop being a draft, and if it does, props to me. This is a way
to document me actually trying to understand all the terms behind web dev, and my
attempt to get something really performant and slim working.

Now, what web dev work have I done before? Besides my current work, which I'd rather
not go into, I worked mostly with Angular. Not fun, but not that bad. Lots of
existing components, and the ones we needed to add were pretty sturdy, so not much
worry there. Very boilerplate-y, but it worked!

I'm at a point where I need to define (or at the very least, advise on) a new stack
for work. Front, back end, db, you name it. Lots of work, but lots of opportunity to
grow. So here I am, attempting to make sense of all the things going on in web
development.

HTML, calls a js script, said script runs, and brings back more html. Ok.
