Hello!
This is my portfolio website repository!

It's hosted with Firebase, and it's built using Gatsby, Chakra for the UI components and Framer Motion for animating everything.

Please bear in mind that this is a constant work-in-progress!

## Build instructions:
- I personally use nvm to manage node versions, the project is currently using node v18.9.0.
- Install yarn and gatsby-cli <npm i -g yarn gatsby-cli>.
- Download dependencies with <yarn>.
- Run gatsby develop to host project locally!.
