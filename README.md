I've finally gotten around to building my own website! I fiddled with different frameworks and hosting services, 
and I settled on Github Pages (w/ my custom domain) and Zola, a static site engine. 
Should be more than enough for my needs, and who knows, I might upgrade this to a full-on app in the (far) future.

Since I'm still working out the overall style/feel (and learning Zola + Tachyons, my chosen CSS framework), I haven't deployed the website yet.
I've been a bit more busy than I like with work, but I'll be sure to get some slow progress on this through 2023.

Thank you, please check back soon!
