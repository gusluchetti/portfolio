I've finally gotten around to building my own website! I fiddled with different frameworks and hosting services, 
and my current stack is:
- [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) as my static site generator
- Hosting on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (using my custom domain)

Should be more than enough for now, and who knows, I might upgrade this to a full-on app in the (far) future.
