Hi! After some procrastinating, I've finally gotten around to building my own website. I fiddled with different frameworks and hosting services, and I settled on
Github Pages (using my custom domain) and Zola, a static site engine. Should be more than enough for my needs, and who knows, I might make a full-on app in the (far) future.

Since I'm still working out the overall style/feel (and learning Zola + Tachyons, my chosen CSS framework), I haven't deployed the website yet.
I should have a deployable version in 1-2 weeks (I'd like to **re-deploy the website before 2023-06-09**), if all goes well.

Thank you, please check back soon!
