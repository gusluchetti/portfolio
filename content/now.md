Not super recent news, but I figured I'd catch everyone up to speed in case we haven't had the
chance to chat in a while.

Back in college, I became very fond of A.I., which led to my pursuit of an A.I. masters
degree in the Netherlands, at Utrecht University (whole year of 2022). Although, 
I had to pause my studies, I had the pleasure of working at [source.ag](https://source.ag),
an incredible A.I. startup that focused on increasing productivity for growers. 
I met some amazing people, and found myself being able to work on things that speed up our
whole team! With productivity in mind, I learned a lot when it came to Linux, getting used to the CLI, 
trying tiling window managers and even tinkering with my very own [Neovim](https://neovim.io) 
configuration file. I think most of all, I was, and still am, fascinated by how fast
I can work on the command line, and how easy some tasks became.

Back to the present (mid 2023). I'm employed now (yay!). I've joined [Nitro Agro](https://agro.nitro.com.br/) as a 'Data and Digital Business Analyst',
which is a very fancy title for 'full-stack web dev'. It's been very rewarding to work on a product at a company that doesn't have
much (internal) IT infrastructure set in stone, so there's a lot to work on when it 
comes to setting up new stacks and processes. Very exciting!

Unfortunately, I haven't done much programming since last time. Most I have been able to do was update my dotfiles so they work better
on different operating sytems, which is very neat. 
Current game of choice is [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). Nothing comes close when it comes to automation.
