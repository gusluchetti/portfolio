I'm looking for work, but I'm currently very deep in the recruitment process for an awesome
company! Hopefully I'll be able to share more by next week.

In other non-work-related news, I've put in a LOT of work over the past week into my new
fedora config (checkout my dots repository!), and this website! I managed to get YUZU working
on my PC, but I haven't gotten too far in Zelda TOTK. ACNH is my new go-to when I'm bored.
