So, I'm employed now (yay!). I've joined [Nitro Agro](https://agro.nitro.com.br/) as a 'Data and Digital Business Analyst',
which is a very fancy title for 'doing full-stack work'. It's been very rewarding to work on something at a company that doesn't have
lots of (internal) IT infrastructure set in place, so hopefully I can work on designing said systems in the future!

Unfortunately, I haven't done much programming since last time. Work hasn't been insanely rough but I still end up just gaming, watching TV
or just scrolling on my phone instead of coding any of my side projects (side ideas at this point).
Current game of choice is [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). Nothing comes close when it comes to automation.
