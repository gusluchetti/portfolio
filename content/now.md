I'm doing [Advent of Code 2023](https://github.com/gusluchetti/advent-of-code-2023) 
in Python! Let me know if you're also doing it this year. So far (at day 7 now), it 
hasn't been too hard, except day 5 part 2, which I still haven't quite figured it out. 

These days (mid-2023), I'm employed at [Nitro Agro](https://agro.nitro.com.br/) as a
'Data and Digital Business Analyst'. It's been very rewarding to work on a product at
a company that doesn't have much (internal) IT infrastructure set in stone, so there's
a lot to work on when it comes to setting up new stacks and processes. Very exciting!
