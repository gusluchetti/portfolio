So I wanted to get back into learning web dev by trying out React
for a bit. Cool. An hour in, I get mad I can't auto format, and supposedly
the installed LSP (emmetls) is being weird.

<!-- more -->

Okay, I'll just download a formatting plugin. Oh, there's like 4 options with no 
discerning qualities, and their README's are lackluster? (mostly on me since
I don't understand neovim that well yet, but still). 
Edit my dotfiles, things are not working.
Dotfiles were remote, pull them down. Okay! Formatting done!

Aaaand I'm sucked right back in. Let's redo it all and finally get it this time!!

After fiddling a bit with my existing config, I thought this would be a good time
for a complete reset. Armed with kickstart.nvim, I managed to get quite the config,
and very quickly at that, just by adding my mods on top of the foundations that
kickstart.nvim builds.
