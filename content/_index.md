## bio
Hi! My name is **Gustavo Luchetti**, a 23 year-old full-stack developer currently 
based in São Paulo, Brazil. Besides full-stack, I've worked with data integratiton for a bit,
and studied Artificial Intelligence for a year.\
To no one's surprise, I game a lot! I also go bouldering from time to time, and I make a pretty
good chocolate chip cookie.

## purpose
I see this website as both **journal and portfolio**. It’s very easy these 
days to consume content (or code) and to never give back, so this is my way of 
remeding that. My current goal is to write a blog post once a month, at the very least. 
I’ll try my best to stick to that schedule.
