        Hi! I'm Gustavo Luchetti, 22, and this is my website. I'd like this to be something
        I can always refer to when someone asks for my CV, or wants to know what I'm currently doing,
        be it work or fun-related.
    </p>
    <p class="mr2-l measure-wide text">
        I have 2+ years experience as a full-stack dev, and am currently looking for work!
        I would like to broaden my knowledge in the data-science field, but do get in touch
        if you're looking for someone driven and ready to take on interesting projects!
    </p>
