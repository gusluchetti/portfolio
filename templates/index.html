    Hi! My name is Gustavo Luchetti, a 23 year-old full-stack developer currently 
    based in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm very much a 'computer guy'. I've been interested 
    in them for various reasons over the years: as a kid, for gaming
    on the cheap, as a teenager, I managed to build my own PC, and these days, for all sorts 
    of programming related subjects.
  </p>
  <h2 class="fw9 mv1 b text tc">What subjects?</h2>
  <p class="mt1 mb3 measure-wide text lh-copy">
    Web development (for work), artificial intelligence/data science, and all types
    of automation (infrastructure as code, CI/CD, etc). We all work enough, so let's
    focus on the latter two. 
  </p>

    I became very fond of A.I. in college, which led to my pursuit of an A.I. masters  
    degree in the Netherlands, at Utrecht University. Although I had to pause my studies, I ended up
    working at Source.Ag, a fantastic A.I. startup that focused on increasing productivity
    for growers. With productivity in mind, I got quite deep in the Linux rabbit hole,
    from researching different window managers to tinkering my Neovim configuration
    file daily. I've mostly recovered, but I keep looking into ways to speed up my workflow.

    I see this website as both a journal and as a portfolio. It’s very easy these 
    days to consume content (or code) and to never give back, so this is my way of 
    remeding that. My current goal is to write a blog post once a month, at the very least. I’ll try my best to
    stick to that schedule.
