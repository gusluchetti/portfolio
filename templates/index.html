    Hi! My name is Gustavo Luchetti, a 23 year-old full-stack developer based in Brazil.
  </p>
  <h2 class="fw9 mv1 b text tc">Why do this?</h2>
  <p class="mt1 mb3 measure-wide text">
    I'd like this website to be something I can always refer to when someone wants to know more
    about me, or what I'm currently up to. I feel like it’s very easy to consume content (or code)
    and never give back, so this is my way of remeding that.
  </p>
  <h2 class="fw9 mv1 b text tc">Should I come back often?</h2>
  <p class="mt1 mb3 measure-wide text">
    My current goal is writing a blog post once a month (at the very least)! I’ll try my best to
    stick to that schedule (be warned, topics will vary a lot).
  </p>
