      Hi! My name is Gustavo Luchetti, a full-stack developer based in Brazil.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw9 mv1 b text tc">Why do this?</h2>
    <p class="mt1 mb3 measure-wide text">
      I'd like this website to be something I can always refer to when someone wants to know more
      about me, or what I'm currently up to. I feel like it’s very easy to consume content (or code)
      and never give back, so this is my way of remeding that.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw9 mv1 b text tc">Should I come back often?</h2>
    <p class="mt1 mb3 measure-wide text">
      My current goal is writing a blog post once a month (at the very least)!
      <br />
      I’ll try my best to stick to that schedule (be warned, topics will vary a lot).
