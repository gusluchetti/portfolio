      Hi! My name is Gustavo Luchetti, a full-stack developer based in Brazil.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw9 mv2 b text tc">Why?</h2>
    <p class="measure-wide text">
      I'd like this website to be something I can always refer to when someone wants to know more
      about me, or what I'm currently up to. I feel like it’s very easy to consume content (or code)
      and never give back, so this is my way of remeding that.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw9 mv2 b text tc">When?</h2>
    <p class="measure-wide text">
      My current goal is writing a blog post once a month (at the very least)! I’ll try my best to
      stick to that schedule (be warned, topics will vary a lot).
