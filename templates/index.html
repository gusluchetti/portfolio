  Hi! My name is <strong>Gustavo Luchetti</strong>, a 23 year-old full-stack developer currently 
    based in São Paulo, Brazil. Besides full-stack, I've worked with data integratiton for a bit,
    and studied Artificial Intelligence for a year. 
    <br/>
    To no one's surprise, I game a lot! I also go bouldering from time to time, and I make a pretty
    good chocolate chip cookie.

  I see this website as both <strong>journal and portfolio</strong>. It’s very easy these 
    days to consume content (or code) and to never give back, so this is my way of 
    remeding that. My current goal is to write a blog post once a month, at the very least. 
    I’ll try my best to stick to that schedule.</p>
